    * `Current Assets < 0` is GONE, on both halves. That assertion came from the forbidden fixture and is
      contradicted by company A's own live capture, which shows Current Assets **+2,605,093.00** — because A's
      `Bank Accounts` (+1,696,830) and `Cash-in-Hand` (+23,000) carry the wrong sign for debit-natured groups,
      the known seed defect the tracker records. Those two buckets are therefore deliberately NOT asserted
      here either. In their place this pins the second-level buckets `_verify_balances` actually compares and
      whose live signs are trustworthy: Sundry Debtors (debit, negative), Sundry Creditors (credit, positive),
