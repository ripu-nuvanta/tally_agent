    call inside `load_company_b` is guarded by its own pause-and-recover logic (Ruling C11 / `_create_or_pause`,
    and the explicit try/except around `create_b_voucher`), so `fail_imports` alone never produces a raw
    WriteFailed — it gets caught and turned into CompanyBLoadError instead (see the test below). What isn't
    guarded is company_b.py's handful of plain reads (e.g. `_require_voucher_type`'s very first call,
    `writer.list_voucher_types`) — raising Tally's modal exactly when that read goes out makes every request
    raise `httpx.ReadTimeout`, which `TallyWriter.post` turns into `WriteTimeout` (a `WriteFailed` subclass).
