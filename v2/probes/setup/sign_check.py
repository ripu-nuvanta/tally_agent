"""One-shot live check for Ruling C30 (2026-09-24): does Tally read OPENINGBALANCE's SIGN (negative = Dr)?

Not wired into the CLI — the main agent runs it by hand against a Probe company. Each form creates one throwaway
debtor through the real `create_party_ledger`, reads its OpeningBalance back raw, and deletes it (the v4 "Ledger
delete" shape, `TallyWriter.delete_ledger`, with its own read-back — LESSONS §15).

**Which form discriminates (C38, review 2026-09-24 #6):** `run` sends −1.00 under Sundry Debtors, a debit-natured
group. Under C30 (the sign is read) that is Dr 1 → exported "-1.00"; under C21 (the side is inferred from the
group) it is ALSO Dr 1 → "-1.00". So `run` cannot tell them apart — neither hypothesis predicts +1.00 there.
`run_positive` sends +1.00 under the same group: C30 predicts "1.00" (Cr, contra-natural but as sent), C21 predicts
"-1.00" (Dr, the group's side). `positive_verdict` reads that answer. C30's standing evidence meanwhile is company
A's abs()'d HDFC/SBI openings landing as credits under Bank Accounts — a real discriminator.
