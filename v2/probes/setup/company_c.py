"""Company C's tiny, idempotent loader (S0 spec §4.4; plan part 6): one expense ledger and one Payment voucher.

The company shell is created by hand in the TallyPrime UI (company creation can't be scripted), security and TallyVault
are switched on by hand during probe 24, and no credential ever passes through here. Writes use only verified shapes
(`TallyWriter.create_ledger`, `create_payment`, docs/tally-write-exploration-v4.md) and read each one back.
