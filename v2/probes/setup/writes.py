"""Write helpers for the automated operator (S0-D9, spec §5.8). Verified shapes only:

- Payment via ALLLEDGERENTRIES.LIST + Accounting Voucher View (docs/tally-write-exploration-v4.md Op 8; live 2026-09-22)
- header-field alter and delete by Master ID, DATE="DD-MMM-YYYY" (v4 "Voucher delete"; live 2026-09-22)
- ledger create / delete with NAME.LIST, rename with NAME.LIST (v4 "Ledger delete", "permanent lock"), EMAIL alter
- company rename with a <NAME> child (live 2026-09-22 — the NAME.LIST variant does nothing)

Every write is read back (LESSONS §12). Writes go only to companies with "Probe" in the name; the one exception is
renaming the fresh seed copy to company A, which the operator does only on its own s0probe Tally.

**The dataset<->wire sign boundary (bitten three times — Task 5's inventory unit suffix, Task 6's F11 opening
balance, and F11 itself being wrong, C30):** company_b_data.py signs LEDGER OPENINGS debit-negative, credit-positive,
and that is ALSO what Tally reads on the wire. Two places are signed on the wire:
- `create_b_voucher`'s `lines` (AMOUNT + ISDEEMEDPOSITIVE) — Op 6/7's sign convention (Ruling C22, live-verified).
- `create_party_ledger`'s `opening` → OPENINGBALANCE, sent SIGNED: negative = Dr, positive = Cr (Ruling C30,
  2026-09-24). Tally does NOT infer the side from the parent group — Op 5's gotcha / Ruling C21 / F11 were never
  tested (Op 5 only checked that Capital Account existed). Live evidence: backend/tally_bridge/import_builder.py's
  `abs(opening)` landed company A's HDFC −5,00,000 and SBI −2,00,000 as CREDITS
  (docs/specs/2026-09-21-bi-part1-sync-design.md "Settled 2026-09-23";
  v2/tests/fixtures/sync/c33_untyped_2026-09-23/p18_A_ledger_list.xml shows them positive, like Capital Account). Never re-introduce `abs(opening)`.
A stock opening (`create_stock_item`'s `opening_qty`/`opening_rate`) is a quantity and a rate — never negative — but
its OPENINGVALUE is signed on the wire like a ledger opening: the stock is a debit, so it goes out NEGATIVE (C39).

        method's own balance check is the only thing that proves the two agree. Nothing is sent to Tally until the
        voucher is proven to balance. `BILLALLOCATIONS.LIST` nests only under the line whose ledger equals `party`;
        each bill amount is a MAGNITUDE and is sent with that party line's sign (C34).
        `ISCANCELLED` is never written here (cancelling is not reliably settable on import — Task 6 pause step).

        **Ordering contract for `lines` when `inventory` is non-empty:** the party line first, then the nominal
        Sales/Purchase ledger, then any GST lines — `ACCOUNTINGALLOCATIONS.LIST` on every inventory row points at
        the first non-party line, so a caller that puts a GST line there instead would silently misallocate goods
        to a tax ledger. That nominal line itself is NOT sent (C32) — its amount must equal the signed sum of the
        inventory amounts, which is checked before anything is sent. Enforced only to the extent that `lines` must have at least 2 entries when `inventory` is
        given (`len(lines) >= 2`); the specific ordering itself cannot be checked at this layer (ledger names carry
        no semantic tag) and is the caller's (Task 6's) responsibility.

        **`is_invoice_type` limitation:** invoice mode is decided from the voucher type NAME (`Sales`, `Purchase`,
        or a name starting with either, e.g. `"Sales - GST"` / `"Purchase - GST"`) — this layer has no voucher-type
        collection to look up a type's PARENT. A custom type whose name does not start with Sales/Purchase while
        its parent does (e.g. `"Export Invoice"` parented to `Sales`) will be misclassified as non-invoice and
        emit `ALLLEDGERENTRIES.LIST` + `Accounting Voucher View`, which Tally will likely answer with
        `EXCEPTIONS=1`. Callers naming such a type must alias it to start with `Sales`/`Purchase`.
