"""One-shot LIVE shape probe for a forex voucher (plan part 7, Ruling C36's unblocker). Not wired into the CLI —
run by hand against company B (Task 2's runbook), like sign_check.py. Everything it creates is a throwaway, read
back and deleted, EXCEPT the Currency master, which the forex sales need. Every raw read-back is saved to `out_dir`
(the committed evidence folder) with a summary.json, which is written on EVERY path that gets past the guards —
before the cleanup and again after it (review 2026-09-25 M1/I3).

Review fix round 2026-09-25 (docs/code-review-bi-s0-part7-task1-2026-09-25.md): read-backs are judged on their
VALUES against what was sent (I1); V0 dropped = F2, not a broken shape (I2); a ledger is registered for cleanup the
moment Tally has it (I3); a voucher is deleted only when its read-back MasterID is the LASTVCHID (I4); the currency
is matched on symbol or formal name and an unlisted create is "unverified", never retried (I5); voucher numbers
Sep-2022..FY end are compared before/after (M6). Rulings R-SYM (the base symbol is DISCOVERED — live B's is "?") and
R-F2 (`f2_confirm` replaces the input() pause; refused without a terminal).
