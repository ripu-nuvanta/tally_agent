"""Probe 11: ledger opening balances, the opening bill, and stock openings (S0 spec §7 "Probe 11", B). Feeds R5.

All three are checked against what setup-b wrote (the dataset, via company_b_view), never against another Tally read.
Ledger OpeningBalance is judged against the books-start opening; if it instead equals the current FY's opening, that
is recorded as DIFFERENT and the scope question is left to probe 16 B (S0-D7). The opening-bill candidate is the ledger
master's own BillAllocations; the fallback is Bills Receivable as-on the books start (01-04-2022, day 1, C43).
C46 (live 2026-09-24): StockItem opening fields are the current period's opening. The stock half judges that scope the
way the ledger half judges OpeningBalance's, and every half is named in the summary (the 2026-09-24 run's FAILED stock
half hid a DIFFERENT ledger half).
