"""Probe 22: do forex vouchers expose the INR base amount? (S0 spec §7 "Probe 22", B). Feeds decision 15.

Reads the USD export sales (101/102) with probe 5's confirmed month request — the extractor's own request (S0-D7) —
for the Sep-2022 window (C43-safe: educational 01..02-09-2022). Records every line's raw AMOUNT and any forex-only
fields; `amounts.parse_decimal` raising on an expression is expected (§11.2) and recorded. The forex party's ledger
and the Currency masters are recorded, not judged (plan part 7 Rulings P7-13, P7-14).

Live write shape (plan part 7 Task 2, forex_shape_2026-09-25_run2): company B exports a forex line as
`-$448.44 @ ? 82.99/$ = -? 37216.04` — its base currency is NAMEd "?" (R-SYM) and written with a space. A live voucher
also exports both ALLLEDGERENTRIES.LIST and LEDGERENTRIES.LIST for the same lines, so a voucher is judged on its
primary lines only (`reads.primary_lines`), each posting once."""
