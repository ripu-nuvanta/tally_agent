"""Probe 5: do SVFROMDATE / SVTODATE bound a Voucher collection to a month and a day? (S0 spec §7 "Probe 5", B)

Feeds the S2 extractor's month chunks. C33 (live 2026-09-24): Tally honours the period variables only with
TYPE="Date". Untyped, it silently answers for the company's current period. v2's envelope renderer always types them,
so the typed form is the one under test. The untyped form is sent once as recorded evidence of the silent fallback,
and it never decides the outcome. One Trial Balance pair (typed / untyped) is recorded the same way. Whether an as-on
report is history is probe 18's B part to settle, not this probe's (S0-D7).

C43 (live 2026-09-24, run 1): Educational TallyPrime also ignores a TYPED date variable whose day is not 1, 2 or 31
and answers for the current period instead, so under an educational licence June 2023 is asked as
01-06-2023..02-06-2023 (company_b_view.month_window) — exact, because an educational company holds no voucher on
any other day. The window used is recorded in the observations and the summary.
