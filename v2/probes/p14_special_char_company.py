"""Probe 14: `&` and `'` in the company name (S0 spec §7 "Probe 14", B). Feeds R13.

Three reads of the same Ledger list: the v2 envelope (company name escaped); the same with SVCurrentCompany naming a
company that isn't loaded (control: does Tally even read the variable with one company open?); and last, a deliberately
UNESCAPED copy (raw `&` — not well-formed XML), with a short timeout, after which Tally must still answer.
