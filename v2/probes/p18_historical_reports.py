"""Probe 18 — do TB, Bills and Stock Summary as-on a past date return correct history? (S0 spec §7 "Probe 18", A part)

Feeds decision 11, R30 and Parts 2 + 3. Two sub-verdicts (spec §5.1): TB, and bills/stock; the part outcome is the
worse of the two. The B part (TB as-on 31-03-2023 vs the dataset) comes in plan part 3.

Changed 2026-09-24 (plan part 5): dates audited against C33/C43 — bills/stock as-on moved 30-09-2025 → 31-10-2025;
vouchers read for the whole FY.
