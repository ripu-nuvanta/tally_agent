"""Probe 19 — do AltVchId / AltMstId hold still across a multi-call capture? (S0 spec §7 "Probe 19")

Feeds the quiescence guard (Part 1 §6): read the counters right before and right after a parity capture and discard
the run if they moved. That needs quiet captures to be stable, a report view not to move them, and a voucher entered
mid-capture to move them.
